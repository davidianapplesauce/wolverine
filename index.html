    <div> The wolverine also referred to as the glutton, carcajou, skunk bear, or quickhatch, is the largest land-dwelling 
        species of the family Mustelidae. It is a stocky and muscular carnivore, more closely resembling a small 
        bear than other mustelids. A solitary animal, it has a reputation for ferocity and strength out of proportion 
        to its size, with the documented ability to kill prey many times larger than itself.</div>
